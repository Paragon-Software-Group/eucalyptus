//!         EUCALYPTUS: Elastic Utility Computing Architecture
//!             for Linking Your Programs To Useful Systems
//!
//! EUCALYPTUS is an open source service overlay that implements elastic
//! computing using existing resources. The goal of EUCALYPTUS is to allow
//! sites with existing clusters and server infrastructure to co-host an
//! elastic computing service that is interface-compatible with Amazon's
//! EC2.
//!
//! Because EUCALYPTUS is designed to function as an overlay, it must be
//! able to incorporate resources from different clusters or pools.  For
//! example, EUCALYPTUS allows its administrator to set up a "cloud" that
//! permit users to virtualized OS instances on a number of clusters
//! transparently.  Enabling the necessary network interconnectivity in a
//! way that is secure and portable is one novel feature of EUCALYPTUS.
//! Another stems from its ability to provide interface compatibility with
//! the existing Amazon EC2 service.  EUCALYPTUS users can develop using
//! their own local resources and then transition directly some or all of
//! their functionality to EC2.
//!
//! Finally, a key requirement of EUCALYPTUS is that it be able to serve
//! as a research platform for elastic computing.  To this end, its design
//! makes two significant contributions.  The first concerns the use of
//! scarce network resources in a structured way.  A EUCALYPTUS allocation
//! can function equally well in an environment in which all processors
//! have externally routable IP addresses (e.g. Amazon's current
//! environment) as well as one in which only a certain "front-end
//! machine" is externally routable (as is the case with many production
//! and research clusters today).  Secondly, EUCALYPTUS leverages the
//! extensive Linux packaging and deployment support that is currently
//! available while requiring minimal modification to the existing
//! installed OS base.  Specifically, the target resources need only run a
//! standard hypervisor (Xen, KVM), along with common open-source Linux
//! utilities.  All other functionality installs directly without need for
//! kernel patching or module additions to the host OS domain.
//! </pre>
