        The system has undergone a network partition that lead to a network split between the cloud controllers (CLCs).
        The CLCs may have become inconsistent and to avoid data loss the system has fail-stopped.
        If you are able to determine which of the CLC hosts has your canonical data (HOST_1) and which one doesn't (HOST_2), then:
        0. Backup the /var/lib/eucalyptus/db/ directory on both HOST_1 and HOST_2.
        1. Delete ${DB_LOCK_FILE} on HOST_1.
        2. Start /etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cloud on HOST_1.
        3. Verify that the service is working as expected on HOST_1.
        4. Really. Convince yourself you haven't chosen the wrong database state.
        5. Delete ${DB_LOCK_FILE} on HOST_2.
        6. Start /etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cloud on HOST_2.
        7. Verify that the system comes back up and behaves as you expected.
