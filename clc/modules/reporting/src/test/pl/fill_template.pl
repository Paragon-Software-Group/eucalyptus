# fill_template.pl generates content based upon a template file. It scans through the
#  template file, substituting any variables, and then outputs the result.
#
# Variables within the template file take the format of [VARIABLE_NAME] and are
#  substituted according to the VAR_NAME=VALUE parameters passed to this command.
#
# For example, if you ran: "./fill_template.pl my_file.template FOO=bar", then this script
#  would read the file "my_file.template", replace every occurence of [FOO] with "bar",
#  and output the results.
#
# This scipt is used to _generate_ a perl script, which is then bundled within an image
#  and run automatically upon image startup. This allows the test scripts to control what
#  the image will do upon running it. See: use_resources.template
