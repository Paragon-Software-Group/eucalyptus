# test.pl tests the reporting system, by simulating resource usage and then
# verifying that resultant reports are correct.
#
# Test.pl decomposes the test into a series of phases. Each phase is
# implemented as a separate perl script which this script calls in order. First
# it calls inject.pl to inject a script into the startup sequence of an image
# it will use for testing. Then it calls "simulate_usage.pl" which simulates
# resource usage, using the injected image. Then it calls "check_db.pl" which
# verifies that the values in the database are correct according to the
# simulated usage. Then it calls "check_report.pl" which verifies that
# generated reports are correct according to the simulated usage. Those
# commands can be run manually and separately if desired, however running those
# commands manually would require setting up images etc which this script does
# automatically.
#
# This script accepts several optional arguments: duration_secs,
# write_interval, num_users, num_users_per_account, and num_instances_per_user.
#
# This script has dependencies which can be satisfied by sourcing the "test.sh"
# file.
