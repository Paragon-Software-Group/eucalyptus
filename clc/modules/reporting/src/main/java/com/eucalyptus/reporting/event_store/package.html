<p>The event_store package provides a <i>persistent log</i> of reporting events. It permanently
keeps a record of events which occur in the Eucalyptus system, such as volume creations and deletions,
instance usage, and so on. This log of events is subsequently used to generate visual reports of
Eucalyptus usage.

<p>This packege contains <i>persistent events</i> for: instance creation, deletion, and usage;
volume creation, deletion, and usage; elastic ip creation, deletion, attachment, and detachment;
and s3 bucket and object creation, deletion, and usage.

<p>The events in the event_store package have nothing to do with other event types in the system, and
are not the same as the events which are used to communicate between Eucalyptus subsystems, or from
the CLC to the reporting subsystem. In this case an event refers to an occurence within the Eucalyptus
system (ie volume creation or deletion) which happened at a specific moment, and which should have
a record of it preserved for subsequent report generation.

<p>All events persisted by this package are immutable. Any change to the system is recorded by
additional events. Every persistent event refers to something which happened in the past which
cannot change. This prevents the need to "look up" already existing events as resources are used
in the Eucalyptus system, thereby minimizing the write time on the CLC. It also allows us to keep
a record of everything which has occurred, which would be impossible if we modified database
tuples because previous values would then be lost.  

<p>Although the event types are hibernate objects, this fact should be ignored by anyone
using this package. All hibernate operations are encapsulated within EventStore classes,
which provide methods for inserting persistent events into the event log. There is no
other way to instantiate the event objects (constructors are package access), and no
hiberante operations should take place outside of the EntityStore classes. For example,
if you wanted to record that a volume creation occured, you would call:

<p><code>ReportingVolumeEventStore.getInstance().insertVolumeCreateEvent(uuid, timestampMs, sizeGB, ...)</code>

<p>...and similarly with instance usage, bucket creation, etc etc. 

<p>All hibernate operations are encapsulated within EntityStore objects, because this package
may need to modify objects before they are persisted. This requires that the hibernate operations
be encapsulated.

<p>External users of this package only need to use the EventStore objects, of which there are
six (InstanceEventStore, VolumeEventStore, VolumeSnapshotEventStore, ElasticIpEventStore, 
S3BucketEventStore, and S3ObjectEventStore). All of them are singletons and contain methods for
inserting events such as creations, deletions, and usage.
six. All of them are singletons.

<p>Note that usage events for instances are different from all other usage events. Instance
usage events are persisted at periodic intervals (for example, 4 hours) whereas volume and
S3Object usage events are written as usage occurs, which may be rarely. Also, instances
have no delete events; instances are presumed to be destroyed when their usage events
cease.
