/**
 * <p>AttachDurationCalculator determines an attachment duration, given attachment
 * and detachment times. First you feed in the detachment times, then the attachment
 * times. It stores the detachment times, from which it subtracts the attachment
 * times later when those are fed in.
 * 
 * <p>This result cannot be found by just retaining a Map of detachment times and subtracting
 * later. There can be multiple attachments and detachments of a resource, to and from the
 * same thing. A simple Map would retain only the most recent detachment time and would
 * overwrite any previous time.
 * 
 * <p>This result cannot be found be joining the attachment and detachment tables in the
 * database and subtracting the timestamps. Again, there can be multiple attachment and
 * detachments of a resource, to and from the same thing, so a join would yield a cartesian
 * product of attachments and detachments.
 * 
 * <p>This class handles repeated attachments and detachments of the same resource, to and from
 * the same thing.
 *  
 * <p>This is used to scan through all detachment times in a database, then scan through
 * all attachment times, then find all attachment durations. Thus, finding all attachment
 * durations takes two full table scans. It's not possible to have a single table for
 * attachment and detachment times, then lookup the row and fill in the missing value 
 * upon detachment, as these tables have no indexes for faster insertion.
 * 
 * <p>In all cases, durations will be truncated according to report beginning and end.
